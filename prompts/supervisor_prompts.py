            1. Industry standards and regulations:
            - What specific standards or regulations are relevant to this project?
            - How do these standards impact the design and implementation?

            2. Project-specific requirements:
            - What are the key components or features required for this project?
            - Are there any specific data structures or formats that need to be considered?

            3. Data management:
            - What type of data storage is most suitable for this project?
            - How should the data be structured for efficient retrieval and management?

        Create a list response which containes one well-defined question for each
        category that will help extract detailed information from our knowledge base
        to assist in creating a comprehensive requirements document.

        Evaluate the response based on the following criteria:

        2. Completeness of information
        3. Technical accuracy
        4. Clarity and coherence

        Determine if the response is complete or if a follow-up query is needed.

        If the response is complete, output:
        COMPLETE

        If the response is incomplete or inadequate, output:
        INCOMPLETE

        Follow-up Query: [Provide a single, focused query to retrieve all the missing information]
