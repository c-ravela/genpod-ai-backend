    ArchitectState Class

    This class encapsulates the state of the Architect agent, providing a 
    snapshot of the ongoing project's status and progress. 

    Attributes:
        original_user_input (str): The original set of requirements provided by the user, 
        serving as the foundation for the project.

        user_requested_standards (str): The specific standards or protocols the user has 
        requested to be implemented in the project, which could include coding standards, 
        design patterns, or industry-specific standards.

        project_status (str): An enumerated value reflecting the project's current lifecycle 
        stage, providing real-time tracking of project progress.

        project_path (str): The absolute path in the file system where the project 
        is being generated. This path is used to store all the project-related files and 
        directories.

        license_text (str): The text of the license provided by the user. This text outlines 
        the terms and conditions under which the project can be used, modified, and distributed.

        messages (list[tuple[ChatRoles, str]]): A chronological list of tuples representing the 
        conversation history between the system, user, and AI. Each tuple contains a role 
        identifier (e.g., 'AI', 'tool', 'user', 'system') and the corresponding message.
        
        current_task (Task): The Task object currently in focus, representing the active task 
        that team members are working on.

        project_name (str): The name of the project.

        project_folder_structure (str): The organized layout of directories and subdirectories 
        that form the project's file system, adhering to best practices for project structure.

        requirements_document (str): A comprehensive, well-structured document in markdown 
        format that outlines the project's requirements derived from the user's request. 
        This serves as a guide for the development process.

        tasks (list[Task]): A list of Task objects, each encapsulating a distinct unit of work 
        necessary for the project's completion. These tasks are meant to be carried out by the 
        entire team collectively.

        query_answered (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether the task has been answered
