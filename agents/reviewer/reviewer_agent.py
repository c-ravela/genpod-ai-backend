    The ReviewerAgent class is responsible for conducting comprehensive code reviews, including code quality analysis, 
    security analysis, linting, and documentation checks. It identifies bugs, vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, 
    and missing documentation in the codebase and generates issues based on the findings.

    The ReviewerAgent follows a structured, multi-step process to thoroughly analyze codebases. 
    At each stageâ€”whether it involves code quality checks, security assessments, linting, or 
    documentation verificationâ€”if an issue is detected, the agent halts the review process and 
    escalates the issue to the supervisor for resolution. This ensures that problems are addressed 
    immediately. To optimize resource usage and minimize unnecessary computational costs, the agent 
    stops further analysis upon identifying an issue, preventing redundant operations and conserving 
    resources.
