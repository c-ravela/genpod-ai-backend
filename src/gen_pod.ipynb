Here's the decomposition of the requirements:\\n\\n1. **Project Setup:**\\n   - Create a new project directory at `C:/Users/vkumar/Desktop/user-service`.\\n   - Inside the `user-service` directory, create a standard project folder structure:\\n     - `/app` for application code.\\n     - `/app/models` for database models.\\n     - `/app/api` for REST API endpoints.\\n     - `/app/db` for database configurations.\\n     - `/tests` for test cases.\\n     - `/docs` for documentation.\\n     - `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.\\n     - `main.py` as the entry point of the application.\\n\\n2. **Environment Setup:**\\n   - Initialize a new Python virtual environment within the project directory.\\n   - Install FastAPI and any other necessary libraries (e.g., `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `SQLAlchemy`).\\n\\n3. **Database Configuration:**\\n   - Set up MySQL database connection in `/app/db`.\\n   - Define environment variables for database credentials (to be set up by the user).\\n\\n4. **Model Definition:**\\n   - Define a `User` model in `/app/models` with the following fields:\\n     - `Name` as a string.\\n     - `City` as a string.\\n\\n5. **API Endpoints:**\\n   - Create a FastAPI application in `main.py`.\\n   - Define REST API endpoints in `/app/api` for `User` resource:\\n     - POST to create a new user.\\n     - GET (list) to retrieve all users.\\n     - GET (single) to retrieve a user by ID.\\n     - PUT to update a user by ID.\\n     - DELETE to remove a user by ID.\\n\\n6. **Server Configuration:**\\n   - Configure the server to run on port 3000.\\n   - Set up the SQL database connection using the provided MySQL configuration.\\n   - Ensure that the FastAPI application uses the configured port and database.\\n\\n7. **Testing:**\\n   - Write basic tests in `/tests` to ensure that each endpoint is functioning as expected.\\n\\n8. **Documentation:**\\n   - Document the setup process, API usage, and any assumptions made during development in `/docs`.\\n\\n9. **Execution and Testing:**\\n   - Run the FastAPI application.\\n   - Test the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.\\n\\n10. **Completion:**\\n    - Finalize the project and ensure that all deliverables are met.\\n    - Provide instructions on how to run the application and tests.\\n\\nNow, let's assign these deliverables to the coder:\\n\\n1. **Coder Task 1:** Project and Environment Setup.\\n2. **Coder Task 2:** Database Configuration.\\n3. **Coder Task 3:** Model Definition.\\n4. **Coder Task 4:** API Endpoints Implementation.\\n5. **Coder Task 5:** Server Configuration and Finalization.\\n6. **Coder Task 6:** Testing and Documentation.\\n\\nPlease proceed with Coder Task 1: Project and Environment Setup.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 634, 'prompt_tokens': 249, 'total_tokens': 883}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-1106-preview', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='Architect', id='run-eb44d04d-3f39-4a3d-837b-21484b24aa80-0')],\n",

      "The given JSON text provides a high-level requirement for a service named \"student-service\". This service will be developed in Python, using the gRPC framework (specifically, `grpcio`). The objective is to create a detailed requirement document that can be used by a solution architect to define the scope of the project and break it down into individual deliverables.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Functional Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.1 Service Description:**\n",
      "- Develop a microservice named \"student-service\".\n",
      "- The service should be written in Python programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.2 gRPC Configuration:**\n",
      "- Implement the service using the gRPC framework, utilizing `grpcio`.\n",
      "- The service should expose a server listening on port 50052.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.3 Database Integration:**\n",
      "- The service should interface with an SQL database, referred to as \"Map\" in the requirements.\n",
      "- The database schema and interactions must be designed to support the data model outlined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.4 Data Model:**\n",
      "The service should manage a \"Student\" resource with the following fields and associated data types:\n",

      "- Any supporting scripts or configuration files for deployment and management of the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.2 Database Schema:**\n",
      "- A detailed database schema design to support the \"Student\" data model.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.3 API Documentation:**\n",
      "- Comprehensive API documentation, including example requests and responses for each endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.4 Test Suite:**\n",
      "- Automated test suite covering all aspects of the service functionality.\n",
      "\n",
